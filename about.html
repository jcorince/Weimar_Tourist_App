        Even before the construction of the first Comedy House was played in Weimar theater.
        Troops comedians who have performed there, even before the art-loving Duchess Anna Amalia,
        wife of the Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, a lover of theater for comedies, German Singspiel,
        French drama and opera einrichtete. The amateur theater was a circle of aristocratic and bourgeois audiences;
        Members of the Court, ladies and singer, but also government officials and ministers appeared at various venues
        in the redoubt house in the castle and natural stages of Ettersburg and Tiefurt. Duke Carl August 1791 decided
        the establishment of the Weimar court theater in the comedy house, which was built in 1779 on the present site of the theater.
        Goethe was entrusted with the direction of the Court Theatre, and he opened it in 1791 with Iffland's play The Hunter.
        Goethe saw to it that a group of actors could transform that met the requirements of the classical drama, with its elaborate 
        presentation style after Goethe's rules for actors (1803). The formerly disreputable reputation of acting gave way to a high 
        esteem and social recognition of the actor as an artist personalities.
        But Goethe's efforts to find a theater culture in Weimar was also the audience: sensitivity to beauty and the aesthetic mediation 
        humanist ideals given its "educational" purposes. Without the preferences of the audience for popular pieces such as the duping of
        Kotzebue August, 4806 ideas were Goethe's artistic director, which lasted until 1817, if, that is almost 300 performances per year.
        How much it Goethe went to a comprehensive theater culture is also evidenced by its commitment to the design of the theater space. 
        Outwardly unassuming, the interior of the house on Comedy Goethe operate in a "friendly, shiny Feenschlößchen" was (Caroline Schlegel
        with columns, galleries, balconies, etc. converted to give the audience a completely aesthetic theater experience.
        From 1799 to 1805, the year of death of Schiller, Goethe and Schiller worked, who had since moved from Jena to Weimar,
        Weimar together on the stage. Schiller himself staged his plays The premieres of the three parts of Wallenstein (1798/99) 
        justified Schiller fame as a dramatist. Up to the Maid of Orleans all late dramas of Schiller was first performed in Weimar,
        which then very quickly conquered the world's stages. Inaugurated in 1857 by Ernst Rietschel Dioskurendenkmal symbolizes the
        fruitful joint work of Goethe and Schiller in Weimar. It has become the symbol of the city.
